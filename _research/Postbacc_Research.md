In simulations of protostellar and protoplanetary disks, the effects of enhanced accretion and mass infall are often neglected. My contribution focuses on investigating the observable signatures of accretion by modifying 1-D stellar models in MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) to include several accretion prescriptions, such as viscous and wind-driven accretion. 
In the broader project, disk properties generated from DISKPOP-based models will complement the stellar models. Together, these will ultimately enable a self-consistent population synthesis framework to evaluate whether observed signatures can quantify the importance of accretion variability.
