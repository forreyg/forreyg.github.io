Understanding the local relationship between dust and star formation is essential for determining how dust both regulates and obscures star-forming activity within galaxies. We quantifed the pixel-level relationship between the local star-formation rate (SFR) and dust attenuation in 14 star-forming galaxies at redshifts 1.0-2.5 using slitless spectroscopy from the JWST NGDEEP NIRISS survey. We constructed Balmer decrement maps and derived maps of dust attenuation at H-alpha and intrinsic SFRs. We then measured the cumulative distribution of the local SFR as a function of increasing levels of local attenuation. Across the full sample, we found that 50% of the local star formation occurs behind an attenuation of 3.41 mag or higher. This indicates that the bulk of star formation in these galaxies is significantly attenuated by dust. We also found that 10% of local star formation equals 1.45 for the average profile, indicating that even the least attenuated star-forming regions are still highly attenuated. Our results demonstrate the extremely dusty local conditions of the star-forming interstellar medium in SF galaxies at cosmic noon.
