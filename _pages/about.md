I am a post-bacc researcher at the University of Connecticut. I am currently working within Dr. Aleksandra Kuznetsova's research group on computational astrophysics. 

Currently:
---
I am working on modeling pre-main sequence stars using MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics). I am configuring MESA to add in variable accretion rates, such as wind-driven and viscous accretion. I am provided with properties from disk models built in DISKPOP with an end goal of creating a self-consistent population synthesis model to determine if observational signatures can be leveraged to quantify the importance of variability.

Research Interests:
--
I am interested in galactic structure and evolution, active galactic nuclei (AGN), stellar evolution, star foromation, and accretion disks. 

Education:
-----
I got my undergraduate degree from the University of Connecticut in 2025, where I completed research on spatialy resolved star formation and atenuation in cosmic noon galaxies using data from JWST NIRISS from the NGDEEP collaboration.
